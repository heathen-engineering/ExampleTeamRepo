# Example Team Repository
This repository is an example of how to work with a team on a Unity project where you have 1 or more 3rd party packages installed from a secured repo such as Heathen's Steamworks Complete.

# Steps
The process is simple.
## 1 Create a Private Repo
Create a private repository following the instrucitons in our [Knowledge Base](https://kb.heathen.group/company/development/devops/git-control-and-unity)
Continue by setting up a 3rd party folder in your repo where you can copy any secure assets you need to share, [see our Article here for more info](https://kb.heathen.group/company/development/devops/team-collaboration)!
## 2 Copy the desired assets
In this example we used Steamworks Foundation which is open source and doesn't need to be copied like this but as this repo is public we cannot copy in any actually secured repo so we are using Foundation as a demonstration only.
You should copy in Steamworks Complete, PhysKit, UX and any other 3rd parties you need to personally change control and or any secure repos you are licensed to share and need to share with your team such as Heathen's assets if your a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering)
## 3 Check it in
You must check in your copied results before you can import them into Unity via the Unity Package Manager.
For detailed steps follow our [Knowledge Base guide](https://kb.heathen.group/company/development/devops/team-collaboration).
## 4 Import
As noted in the guide linked above you can now import the assets. The guide demonstrates how to construct your Git URL required by Package Manager.
